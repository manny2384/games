# This Game is built on REACT.js while I was learning of it in one of my web development courses
## Tic Tac Toe
It uses minimax decision making to quantify the outcome of a move and makes a decision based on it.
You can set the difficulty from easy, medium, and hard. The algorithm interprets this as a depth limiter, increasing it's range as the difficulty increases.

I have a similar minimax decision algorithm built for tic tac toe only it is written in lisp, a requirement for my AI course using a 4x4 board instead of the normal 3x3, If you would like to see it click [here](https://github.com/manny2384/cs461/blob/main/hw5.lisp).

## Connect 4
Like Tic Tac Toe, this game too uses minimax decision making.
